![Fake News Classifier](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fake%20News%20Classifier-Verified-brightgreen.svg)

Welcome to the Fake News Classifier project! This repository contains a fake news classifier built using machine learning techniques to differentiate between real and fake news articles.

## Overview

### Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to classify news articles as real or fake.
- **Dataset**: The classifier is trained on a comprehensive dataset of news articles to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Web Application**: A simple web application is provided for users to interact with the classifier and test news articles.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 or higher)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (Python package manager)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Fake News Classifier:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/nikhilm21/Fake-News-Classifier.git
   cd Fake-News-Classifier

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Train the Model**:
   
    You can train the classifier using your own dataset or use the pre-trained       model provided in the models directory. If you choose to train the model,         follow the instructions in the train_model.ipynb Jupyter notebook.

3. **Run the Web Application**:

   To start the web application, run the following command:
   ```shell
   python app.py
  This will launch the web application locally, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
